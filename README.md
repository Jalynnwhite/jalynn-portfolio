 Jalynns Portfolio Project
    As a client searching for a entry level develoer I want to see their skills and previous web developments. I want to know why their work fits the criteria needed and how they are able to dislay their skills onto their portfolio. 

    There should be an about me section, skills section, work experience section, and a contact section on the portfolio page.
